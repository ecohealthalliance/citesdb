#' The CITES database package
#'
#' **citesdb** provides over 40 years of wildlife trade data from the [Convention on
#' International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora](https://www.cites.org).
#' These data on imports and exports of CITES annex species are provided by
#' CITES member countries to the CITES secretariat.
#'
#' This package allows you to download the full database of historic transactions
#' (commonly called the [CITES Trade Database](https://trade.cites.org/))
#' to analyze locally on your computer. Because of the large size of this data,
#' the **citesdb** package stores it as an on-disk [MonetDB](https://www.monetdb.org/)
#' that can be queried without loading into RAM.
